Have you been asked about your career goal whether by your professor or parents? I did not have a clear answer to that question until my third year of college. I have been asked a couple of times since high school but I still did not have a clear vision of what I wanted to pursue. Though I have decided to pursue the STEM field, I did not have a set goal. I was not fully confident about my decision in majoring in Computer Engineering until after trying different things. 

## My experience in Software Engineering
Through internships and hackathons, I was able to gain new skill sets in a rapid environment while solving real-world problems. A fast-changing environment also means that new technology launches in any instance that provides more possibilities. There were challenges but the outcome was rewarding. Something that I learned from previous experiences is that software engineers do not simply code, they work in teams to design, build, and test their solutions. Therefore, I enjoyed working in a multi-functional team to deliver solutions to client and solves their problems. 
## What are the next steps? 
In the future, I hope to work on various projects that utilize trending technologies such as artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, and autonomous navigation. In addition to becoming a full-stack web/ app developer, I would also like to explore user experience and user interface. The most difficult part of software engineering is not about delivering the product but designing a product that will benefit and suit the needs of the client. There are many possibilities in the future so I hope to maintain an open mindset and keep trying new things. It is never too late to pick up a new skill!
