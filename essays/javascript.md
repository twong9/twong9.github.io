Javascript is one of the most powerful languages in software engineering. It is known for its flexibility and compatibility with other languages/tools. Different from other hardware languages such as C/C++, Javascript functions are considered “first-class” since they can be assigned to variables that can be easily manipulated. Because of that, Javascript has been one of my favorite programming languages in software development. Having to work with various programming languages in projects has helped me gain introductory knowledge to many languages but not necessarily an “expert” in one language. 

## In the context of programming

The Basic JavaScript and ES6 modules from freeCodeCamp are practical to those who have not coded in a while or just getting started. It is impossible for software developers to master every programming language because technologies change rapidly these days. Most of them obtain a new skill set when working on a new project. Similarly, I did not have the proper training in Javascript because most of my knowledge was based on prior projects. I was able to refresh and enhance my knowledge on new features after going through the modules. To give a few examples, arrow functions, classes, and promises are the essential features of Javascript. I personally learned the most from the ES6 module and reviewed the fundamentals from the Basic JavaScript module. 

## In the context of engineering

Everything takes practice! In my opinion, athletic software engineering is a great way to help developers to stay on track. Just like playing an instrument or playing soccer, the player cannot go on stage without any practice. It would be impossible to master a skill without trying it even if they are prodigies. Therefore, workouts of the day (WODs) are necessary just like your daily routine. I was not confident about my first WOD; however, I was excited after completing it on time. It might be stressful in the beginning but the outcomes are rewarding.
